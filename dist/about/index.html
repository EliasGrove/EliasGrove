# About Elias Grove

Elias Grove writes fiction that leans toward the odd, the gritty, and the quietly unsettling. Heâ€™s more interested in peeling back the wallpaper of everyday life than putting on a show.

His stories tend to orbit around lonely people making strange decisions, often with consequences that spiral into the surreal. He doesn't believe in bios that try too hard, and figures the writing should speak louder than any list of accolades.

He lives in Portugal. Occasionally regrets not becoming a vet. Often writes at night.
